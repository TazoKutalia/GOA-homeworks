        <h1 id="introduction">Information about Pandas</h1>
        <p>panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is used to distinguish it from the distantly related red panda.  </p> 
        <p>Adult individuals average 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb), and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long. The species is sexually dimorphic, as males are typically 10 to 20% larger. The fur is white, with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. </p> 
        <p>Giant pandas have adapted larger molars and expanded temporal fossa to meet their dietary requirements.</p>

        <h2 id="habitat">Habitat</h2>
        <p>The giant panda is exclusively found in six mountainous regions in a few provinces. It is also found in elevations of up to 3,000 m (9,800 ft).</p> 
        <p> They once lived in lowland areas, but farming, forest clearing and other development now restrict giant pandas to the mountains.</p>

        <h2 id="diet">Diet</h2>
        <p>Its diet consists almost entirely of bamboo, making the bear mostly herbivorous, despite being classified in the order Carnivora.</p> 
        <p>Pandas evolved the ability to effectively digest starch, making the shoot an important energy source.</p> 
        <p>Though mostly starch, bamboo shoots are 32% protein, and therefore a good substitute for a carnivorous diet. </p>

        <h2 id="facts">Interesting Facts</h2>
        <p>Pandas have an extended wrist bone that functions like a thumb and helps them grip bamboo.</p>
        <p>They are solitary animals, with males and females typically coming together only during the breeding season.</p>
        <p>Pandas have a slow reproductive rate, with females being able to conceive only for a few days each year.</p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

        <p>Pandas are iconic and beloved animals, often seen as symbols of wildlife conservation efforts worldwide.</p>
