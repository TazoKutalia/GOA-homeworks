        <h1 id="introduction">Information about Hyenas</h1>
        <p>Hyenas or hyaenas are feliform carnivoran mammals belonging to the family Hyaenidae</p>
        <p> With just four extant species, it is the fifth-smallest family in the order Carnivora and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia.</p>
        <p>Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems.</p>

        <h1 id="Origin">Origin</h1>
        <p>Hyenas originated in the jungles of Miocene Eurasia 22 million years ago, when most early feliform species were still largely arboreal. </p>
        <p>The first ancestral hyenas were likely similar to the modern African civet; one of the earliest hyena species described, Plioviverrops, was a lithe, civet-like animal that inhabited Eurasia 20-22 million years ago, and is identifiable as a hyaenid by the structure of the middle ear and dentition. </p>
        <p> The lineage of Plioviverrops prospered, and gave rise to descendants with longer legs and more pointed jaws, a direction similar to that taken by canids in North America.</p>
        <p>Hyenas then diversified into two distinct types: lightly built dog-like hyenas and robust bone-crushing hyenas.</p>
        <p> the bone-crushing hyenas (including the extant spotted, brown and striped hyenas) became the undisputed top scavengers of Eurasia and Africa.</p>

        <h2 id="diet">Diet</h2>
        <p>Hyenas are not picky eaters.
            On the contrary, about 70 percent of their diet is composed of direct kills. They consume animals of various types and sizes, carrion, bones, vegetable matter, and other animal droppings.</p>


         <h2 id="facts">Interesting Facts</h2>
         <p>Of our planets four different species of hyena, the spotted hyena is the largest and most common.</p> 
         <p>These amazing animals inhabit savannahs, grasslands, woodlands and forest edges across sub-Saharan Africa.</p> 
         <p> The spotted hyenas body can grow to almost 2m long, plus a dark, bushy tail measuring 25-30cm long. Females are heavier than males, and can weigh up to 82kg.</p> 
         <p> They have a sandy, ginger-coloured coat with black markings on their body and legs. They sport a cool, short mane on their neck and shoulders</p>
         <p>Famed scavengers, these cool carnivores have a reputation for eating the leftovers of other predators. But dont be fooled, theyre super-skilled predators themselves! In fact, they hunt and kill most of their food.</p>
         <p>Spotted hyenas often hunt in groups and can take down big animals such as wildebeest, antelope, zebras and young hippos. Smaller snacks on their menu include birds, fish, snakes, lizards and insects, too.</p>

         <p>Spotted hyenas are social mammals and live in structured groups, called clans, of up to 80 individuals. Theres a strict hierarchy, where females rank higher than males, and the group is led by one powerful alpha female.</p>
         <p> Spotted hyenas are also known as laughing hyenas. Why? Because these highly intelligent creatures communicate with yells, whoops and cackles some of which can be heard almost 5km away</p>

         <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
         <p>hyenas are very intelligent and awesome animals.</p>
